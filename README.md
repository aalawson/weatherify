## About Weatherify
Weatherify is an app for music playlists based on the weather.

Our app creates playlists based on the weather. We use your location 
via your IP address to get your local weather and create a playlist of 
songs that suit this weather. This is decided based on the mood, 
danceability, BPM, energy, etc. of a song, all of which was extracted from 
both the Spotify and the Echo Nest APIs. 

You will also be able to enter a different location and get a playlist 
for that place’s weather. After a default playlist is created, you 
will be able to manually adjust the parameters (mood, danceability, BPM, 
energy, etc) from your weather-based defaults using sliders to adapt the 
playlist to your taste. You will also be able to add and remove songs from 
the created playlist.

To add songs, you will be able to search by a number of features. You will 
then be able to save playlists you have made between sessions. There will 
also be an option to enter opposite mode. For example if it’s rainy, rather 
than playing slow, quiet music, the playlist created will be reminiscent of 
a sunny day.
